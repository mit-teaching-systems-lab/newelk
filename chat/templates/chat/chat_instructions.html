<p>
  One of the roles you can play in ELK is the teacher role. In this role, you are part of a live chat conversation with someone playing the role of the student. Both of you are given a scenario and you are given a description of what you want to know the studentâ€™s thoughts about. The student is given a description of their preconceptions. In standard play, you, as the teacher, can type any message in the chat box, but in this tutorial, you will be choosing a provided option.
